## Acknowledgments

I had the idea to make this program after wasting time searching on Ebay for the products I wanted.

This was my first coding project and I learned a lot, including the following:

- Working with RESTful APIs, reading documentation, parsing API responses, etc.
- Making multiple python files work with each other
- How to send outgoing email from python
- Working with .json files
- Using different modules
- How to log using logging module
- Creating a README and LICENSE
- Setting a function to execute on an interval
- Using Git and Github
